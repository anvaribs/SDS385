# Last peer review

### Instructions:

As we discussed in class, please send me your last peer review by Wednesday, December 13th. This shouldn't take you more than 30-60 minutes. Just write out a short e-mail giving "shout-outs" to folks that have helped you learn throughout the semester. This can take many forms:
- people that you studied/did the exercises with and that were good sources of support and collaboration.
- someone who did a particularly excellent presentation in class that help you learn something interesting or
  important.
- someone who put some particularly readable and helpful code up on GitHub that helped you in your own coding efforts
- someone who gave you a great peer review on one of the previous two assignments.
- someone you peer reviewed that you learned something from.
- anything else! This list isn't exhaustive.
================================================================

Since this semester is my 9th semester at UT and I am very close to graduation, I decided to take this course "Statistical Models for big data" on the credit/no credit basis and was amazed by how much I learned from this course. At the beginning, I was a little bit unsure about the Moore-methodology that James use for his courses. But now I feel like I really liked this method of teaching and learning. As James mentioned in the first lecture, although we have not learned about many different subjects, but what we learned we learned it much more deeply. This semester was a great learning journey for me. 

Here I am going to thank some of the people who helped me learn better and faster in this course:



**Bowen Hua** --> His assignment presentations was very clear and to the point. He presented ADMM method in a very nice and concise way. His code was always very clear and step-by-step. I learned alot from him. Thanks Bowen, you are awesome.


**Mauricio Garcia** --> I also learned many useful thing from Mauricio. He had a great insight into some of the subjects that we learned in this class, and his ability to convey those insights were extraordinary. Thanks Mauricio and keep up the great work.


**Aaron Webb** --> Aaron in-class presentation on gradient boosted trees and their application in Physics were great. I enjoyed his presentation and learned a great deal from it.


And finally, I want to give a shout-out to **James Scott** for being such a great professor. He did a great job of leading the class and clarifying some of the subjects. I, personally, learned a lot from him. Thank you James, I really appreciate your help and support.
