# Last peer review

### Instructions:

As we discussed in class, please send me your last peer review by Wednesday, December 13th. This shouldn't take you more
than 30-60 minutes. Just write out a short e-mail giving "shout-outs" to folks that have helped you learn throughout the
semester. This can take many forms:
- people that you studied/did the exercises with and that were good sources of support and collaboration.
- someone who did a particularly excellent presentation in class that help you learn something interesting or
  important.
- someone who put some particularly readable and helpful code up on GitHub that helped you in your own coding efforts
- someone who gave you a great peer review on one of the previous two assignments.
- someone you peer reviewed that you learned something from.
- anything else! This list isn't exhaustive.
