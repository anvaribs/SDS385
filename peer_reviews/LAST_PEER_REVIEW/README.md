# Last peer review

### Instructions:

As we discussed in class, please send me your last peer review by Wednesday, December 13th. This shouldn't take you more than 30-60 minutes. Just write out a short e-mail giving "shout-outs" to folks that have helped you learn throughout the semester. This can take many forms:
- people that you studied/did the exercises with and that were good sources of support and collaboration.
- someone who did a particularly excellent presentation in class that help you learn something interesting or
  important.
- someone who put some particularly readable and helpful code up on GitHub that helped you in your own coding efforts
- someone who gave you a great peer review on one of the previous two assignments.
- someone you peer reviewed that you learned something from.
- anything else! This list isn't exhaustive.

**Bowen Hua** --> His assignment presentations was very clear and to the point. He presented ADMM method in a very nice and concise way. His code was always very clear and step-by-step. I learned alot from him. Thanks Bowen, you are awesome.


**Mauricio Garcia** --> I also learned many useful thing from Mauricio. He had a great insight into some of the subjects that we learned in this class, and his ability to convey those insights were extraordinary. Thanks Mauricio and keep up the great work.


**Aaron Webb** --> Aaron in-class presentation on gradient boosted trees and their application in Physics were great. I enjoyed his presentation and learned a great deal from it.


And finally, I want to give a shout-out to **James Scott** for being such a great professor. He did a great job of leading the class and clarifying some of the subjects. I, personally, learned a lot from him. Thank you James, I really appreciate your help and support.
