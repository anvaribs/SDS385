# Peer Review: [Anthony Dutcher](https://github.com/tonydutcher)

### General Comments on Overall Approach:
Overally, you did a great job in excerceise 1 and 2. The fact that you are combining the text and python code in a notebook makes the notebook self-sufficient. It is very clear what you are planning to do and every small step that you take to tackle that step. In the first homework, you have benchmarked different methods using different plots that makes it much more easy to compare and understand. 

### coding style:
You have used jupyter notebook that in my humble opinion, is a great tool for both learning and developing. Still, when I want to develop a new code fron scratch, the first thing that I do is to open a jupyter notebook and code there or at least to try different ideas in a notebook and then try to convert it to a .py script. The fact that it is really easy to combine text, code, and plots in the same notebook make it a great tool. 

At the same time, you have tried to write a very module code that makes it great for both learning and also maintaining and developing on top of. 

Wherever that is possible you have used an external library such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib and sklearn and did not reinvent the wheel which is a great coding habit. Great job overall. 


### Readibility of the code:
A lot of inline comments and also combining text and code makes your code very readible and comprehinsible. It is obvious that you have spent some serious time generating great plots. Visualization is an important skill for a data-scientist and I see in your notebooks that you did a great job mastering it.
